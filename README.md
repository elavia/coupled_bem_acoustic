# Coupled BEM acoustic

Julia code for acoustic transmission scattering by BEM using planar triangular meshes.
The code is organized in one main file
```
jul_main.jl
```
which must be loaded previously to any script run. This file loads all the necessary
files (which resides in the `src` directory).
In this file the user can configure its parallel environment (i.e. how much processors
he has in the machine running Julia). By default this number is 1 (single core machine)
but, nevertheless, I recommend to use as many cores as you can.


## Memory considerations




Thank you for try the code.
Any suggestions and comments will be welcomed at sivasadartantasvueltasnosirve@gmail.com.
